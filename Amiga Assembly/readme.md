Explanation
Program Structure

   /Initialization:
        Interrupts are disabled by clearing INTENA ($DFF09A).
        DMA channels are disabled initially via DMACON ($DFF096) to safely configure the hardware.
        The Copper list is set up and its address is loaded into COP1LC ($DFF080).
        DMA is enabled for the Copper, bitplanes, and sprites with $8380 in DMACON.
    Main Loop:
        The program polls the CIA-A interrupt control register ($BFED01, bit 3) to check for keyboard data.
        When data is ready, it reads the scancode from $BFEC01 and checks if it matches $10 (the 'Q' key scancode with bit 7=0 for key down).
        If 'Q' is pressed, it enters an infinite loop (QUIT). In a real application, you’d restore the system state and exit cleanly, but this is omitted for simplicity.

Copper List

/     Screen Setup:
        BPLCON0 ($0100) is set to $9200 for a low-resolution screen with 1 bitplane and color enabled.
        DIWSTRT ($008E) and DIWSTOP ($0090) define a 320x256 display window for PAL.
        DDFSTRT ($0092) and DDFSTOP ($0094) set the data fetch range for low-res mode.
        A single bitplane is pointed to $20000, though it’s not used (assumed blank).
    Sprite Pointers:
        Seven sprites (SPR0 to SPR6) are pointed to memory locations starting at $21000, with each sprite data block 72 bytes ($48) apart: $21000, $21048, $21090, $210D8, $21120, $21168, $211B0.
    Colors:
        COLOR00 ($0180) is black ($0000) for the background.
        Sprite colors are set to white ($0FFF) at COLOR17, COLOR21, COLOR25, COLOR29, COLOR33, COLOR37, and COLOR41, corresponding to color 1 for each sprite (sprites use colors 16+n4 to 19+n4, and color 1 is bitplane 0=1, bitplane 1=0).

Sprite Data

 /   Each sprite is 16 pixels wide and 16 lines high, positioned at Y=100 (VSTART=$64), with VSTOP=Y+16=$74.
    Horizontal positions (HSTART) are spaced 40 pixels apart: X=20, 60, 100, 140, 180, 220, 260.
    Control words are calculated as:
        First word: (VSTART<<8) | (X>>1)
        Second word: (VSTOP<<8) | ((X&1)<<1), but since all X values are even, this simplifies to (VSTOP<<8).
    Pixel data is $FFFF, $0000 for 16 lines (bitplane 0 all 1s, bitplane 1 all 0s = color 1), followed by $0000, $0000 to mark the end.

Assumptions and Notes

  /  Memory: The bitplane is at $20000 (assumed cleared), and sprite data is hardcoded to start at $21000. In practice, these should align with the actual addresses of SPRITE0 to SPRITE6 as placed by the assembler, or memory should be dynamically allocated.
    Hardware Access: The program takes over the hardware directly, bypassing the AmigaOS. A real application would use system calls (e.g., Exec library) and restore the system state on exit.
    Keyboard: Polling the CIA-A chip for scancode $10 detects 'Q'. This is a basic method; interrupts or system routines would be more robust.

This code, when assembled and run on an Amiga 1200, will display 7 white rectangular sprites across a black screen and exit (loop) when 'Q' is pressed. Ensure the sprite data matches the copper list pointers if modifying the memory layout.
