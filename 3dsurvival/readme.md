# 3D Survival
<br>

Here's a basic 3D survival game using OpenGL and SDL2. The code creates a small test environment with the following features:

# Player Movement:

WASD keys to move horizontally
Space to move up
Left Shift to move down
Mouse to look around


# Game Environment:

A flat green ground
Several trees (brown trunks with green foliage)
Random rocks scattered around
Red collectible resources
A blue water pool


# Survival Mechanics:

Health and hunger stats
Hunger decreases over time
When hunger reaches zero, health decreases
Collecting red resources restores health and hunger


# Collision Detection:

Simple collision detection for item collection
Boundary limits to keep the player in the game area

To compile this code, you'll need to have the following libraries installed:

SDL2
GLEW
GLM
